Hi! My name is Jan Czarnowski, I am a **PhD Student at Imperial College London** under the
supervision of [Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd). Prior to that I led a team of
robotics researchers in [PIAP](https://piap.pl/en), Warsaw. 
My research focuses on integrating **Deep Learning** with **Dense Visual SLAM** in
order to push the boundaries of spatial perception with a single camera.
I enjoy building systems that work in **real-time** and produce good-looking 3D visualisations
and probably spend too much time on computer games.

My name is Jan Czarnowski and I am a PhD Student in Dyson Robotics Lab of
Imperial College London, working on efficient computer vision/SLAM for
robotics. I am supervised by prof. Andrew Davision and dr Stefan Leutenegger.
Previously, I've studied Computer Science (BSc) and Robotics (BSc + MSc) at
Warsaw University of Technology. I've also been leading the Autonomous Systems
Team in Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements (PIAP) in
Warsaw.  I am passionate about robots and computers -- my research interests
revolve around robustifying SLAM with deep learning and novel processor
architectures more suitable to the sparse nature of intelligent algorithms. 
Outside of research I play a lot of computer games and like to do programming.
